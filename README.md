# RLCraft-Vagrant

This is a Vagrant-enabled automatic setup for a modded Minecraft server pack called RLCraft.

## Running

Install Vagrant, and run `vagrant up` in this directory in a terminal.

Becausususase I'm too dumb and lazy to figure out how to automate this, you need to run `vagrant ssh` after doing this and then you need to paste in a command that the vagrant machine should display.

The password is `vagrant`.

## Connecting

Connect on port `25565` with RLCraft.
