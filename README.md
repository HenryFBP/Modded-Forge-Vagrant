# RLCraft-Vagrant

This is a Vagrant-enabled automatic setup for a modded Minecraft server pack
called RLCraft.

## Running

[Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), and run `vagrant up` in this
directory in a terminal.

Because I'm too dumb and lazy to figure out how to automate this, you need to
run `vagrant ssh` after doing this and then you need to run a few commands to
start the server.

The password is `vagrant`, and the username is `vagrant`.

## Connecting

Connect on port `25565` with RLCraft.
