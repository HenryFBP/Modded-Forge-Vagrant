# pyminecraftserver

This is a Python module to automate the process of setting up, configuring, and installing mods to minecraft servers.

## Setup

Install `pipenv` with `pip install pipenv`.

Then, run `pipenv install` to create a new virtualenv with all of the deps specified in `./Pipfile`.

You can also run `pipenv install --system` to install the dependencies globally.

## Demos

Run `simple_server_setup_demo.py`, `simple_json_server_setup_demo.py` or `interactive-server-starter.py` for a taste of how this library can work.

I highly recommend `interactive-server-starter.py`.
